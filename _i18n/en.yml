In Kiel the preliminary application will be given online. Start of the application period will be published on oour website or via our newsletter. Please note that IAESTE is only procuring internships, the final decision is always made by the according employer.
        - question: Are the internships paid?
          answer: "IAESTE internships are paid. The wage depends on the employer and covers at least the living costs in the according country. As an example: At the moment the IAESTE minimum wage in Germany is 650 €."

          answer: There is a list on the homepage of the national commitee where you can find current offers all year long. Just check this list once in a while and contact us immediately if there is an offer you're interested in.
        - question: Why is there no company name on my offer?
          answer: To protect the data security of the company firstly no contact details are given to avoid premature contact of the applicants with the company. This is necessary to keep the organisational work for the company as low as possible. After definite acceptance and payment of the deposit you will get further information about your employer.
        - question: Why do I need to pay 75€ deposit for my offer?
          answer: To make sure that you are really interested in the offer you need to pay a deposit of 75€ to our local commitee in Kiel. This is necessary because there is only one applicant per offer; for the well of the employer this place shall definetly be used. After finishing the internship and giving in the internship report or if the employer did not accept your application we will return your deposit.

      questions:
        - question: Will the lodging be arranged for me?
          answer: Yes, the local commitee will arrange a room for you?
        - question: Do I need to share my room?
          answer: No. It is very likely that you have to share bathroom and kitchen. But usually everybody gets his own room.
        - question: How high is the rent in Kiel?
          answer: Generally the rent in Kiel is slightly lower than in other bigger cities in Germany. We will try to to arrange a room that does not exceed 260€ per month but we can't promise. For us it is always helpful when the internships are during the months june to september and does not start or end in the middle of a month.
        - question: What do I have to do if in the end I can't attend my internship?
          answer: Contact as soon as possible the according local commitee to make it possible to pass the internship place to someone else.
        - question: What do I need to consider?
          answer: An important tip for our incomer - Downloading from music and movies via filesharin (torring etc.) is illegal in Germany and will be prosecuted. Please download everything necessary before arriving in Germany and delete the software. Already opening the programm accidently and the associated download of few megabytescan lead to a fign of several 1000€. Please take care!

    - title: Companies
      questions:
        - question: Which demands can I make for the potentail interns?
          answer: In the offer form you can define desired language requirements, country of origin, major and finished semesters as well as work experience. For example if you only want to accept master students or someone from Poland, this is no problem. If you have any further professional requirements like computer languages or practical lab experience, you can define them of course. Furthermore of course also the time period can be defined. 
        - question: How many applications do I need to read before I will find an appropriate intern?
          answer: Usually only one - local and national commitee of Germany and the country of origin do some prework. Only if the applicants fulfill all requirements and his application is complete the application wil be forwarded to you. In the unlikely case of an application from an unqualified applicant you can decide whether or not you want to accept another application.
        - question: Am I allowed to reject taking an intern?
          answer: This is theoretically possible at any time. If already someone applied and you might have even accepted him or her already this of course leads to a big disappointment. But there will be no disadvantages for you. If you have any problems or questions please contact us anytime!
        - question: Do we have to find an appartment for the intern and arrange the visa for him/her?
          answer: No. You are only responsible for the arrangement of the internship. The local commitee Kiel will take care of finding an appartment and the possibly necessary visa will be organized by the student himself. The employment permit or relief from it will be arranged by the DAAD.
        - question: What wage level is adequate?
          answer: At the moment (beginning 2017) IAESTE-interns in Germany get at least 670€ per month. This amount is geared to the Bafög level. Please consider that some students are from poor countries and depend on their wage to make a living from it. If the employer is a university or a research institute part of the costs can be paid by the DAAD. This must be clearified in the individual case. For internships which last longer than three months minimum wage must be paid, unless the internship is verifiable part of the studies of the intern (which can be listed as a requirement in the offer form).
        - question: Does the intern have an insurance for the case he gets sick or anything will be damaged?
          answer: Yes. The DAAD will organize the insurance and will pay for it. It is a complete health and liability insurance by Continentale. If you have questions about the extent of the insurance feel fre to ask us.
